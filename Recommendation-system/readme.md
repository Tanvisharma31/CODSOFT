# Diet Plan Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project is a diet plan recommendation system that suggests personalized diet plans to users based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and health goals. The system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend suitable diet plans to users.

## Features

- Personalized diet plan recommendations based on user preferences.
- Dietary restriction awareness (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
- Health goal alignment (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance).
- Nutritional balance considerations.
- User feedback incorporation for improving recommendations.

## How It Works

The diet plan recommendation system works in the following steps:

1. **User Profile Creation**: Users provide information such as age, gender, weight, height, dietary restrictions, and health goals.

2. **Preference Analysis**: The system analyzes user preferences based on the provided information.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Collaborative filtering is used to recommend diet plans by finding similarities between users with similar profiles.

4. **Content-Based Filtering**: Content-based filtering is employed to recommend diet plans based on the nutritional content and suitability for the user's dietary restrictions and health goals.

5. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the analysis from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, personalized diet plans are generated and recommended to the user.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Users can provide feedback on recommended diet plans, which is used to improve future recommendations.
