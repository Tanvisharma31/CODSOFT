# Tennis Chatbot

## Introduction

The Tennis Chatbot is a simple conversational agent designed to engage users in conversations related to tennis. It responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements and pattern matching techniques. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

## Features

- Responds to user queries related to tennis.
- Provides information about players, tournaments, rules, and terminology.
- Engages users in casual conversations about tennis topics.
- Offers assistance with finding tennis courts, equipment, and training resources.

## How It Works

The Tennis Chatbot operates in the following manner:

1. **User Input**: Users interact with the chatbot by typing messages or questions related to tennis.

2. **Input Processing**: The chatbot processes the user input using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify the intent of the query.

3. **Rule-Based Responses**: Based on the identified intent, the chatbot provides predefined responses tailored to the user query.

4. **Conversation Flow**: The chatbot engages users in conversations, providing information, answering questions, and maintaining a natural dialogue flow.

## Implementation

The Tennis Chatbot is implemented using Python and a suitable natural language processing library such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or SpaCy. The core logic involves defining rules and patterns to match user inputs and generating appropriate responses.
