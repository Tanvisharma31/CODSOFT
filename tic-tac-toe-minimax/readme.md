# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

## Introduction

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent is a Python program that allows a human player to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. The AI player is implemented using algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make it unbeatable. This project aims to provide an understanding of game theory and basic search algorithms.

## Features

- Allows human players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- Implements the Minimax algorithm with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal decision-making by the AI.
- Provides a challenging gameplay experience by ensuring the AI player is unbeatable.
- Supports customizable board sizes for extended gameplay options.

## How It Works

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent operates as follows:

1. **Game Initialization**: The Tic-Tac-Toe board is initialized, and the game begins.

2. **Player Turns**: Players take turns making moves by placing their respective symbols (X or O) on the board.

3. **AI Decision**: When it's the AI player's turn, it uses the Minimax algorithm with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine the best move to make.

4. **Move Execution**: The AI player makes its move, and the game continues until a win, loss, or draw condition is reached.

5. **Game Outcome**: The game ends when one player achieves a winning configuration, the board fills up (draw), or the game is terminated manually.

## Implementation

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent is implemented in Python, leveraging object-oriented programming principles. The core logic involves the implementation of the Minimax algorithm with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to enable the AI player to make optimal moves.

## Usage

To play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI Agent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvisharma31/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
   ```

3. Run the game script:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves and play against the AI opponent.

## Customization

- **Board Size**: You can customize the board size to create larger Tic-Tac-Toe grids by modifying the appropriate parameters in the code.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
